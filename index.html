        <h1>Escape Anxiety Guidebook</h1>
        <p>You have been chosen as your group’s guide through the escape room. Your role is to allow your team to do their best to solve each puzzle, while prompting them and providing hints if they get stuck. The correct order of puzzles as well as their respective answers are provided below. As you complete each puzzle, please return any items you’re done using to their original location.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Before you enter the escape room, each member of your team must write down their number one anxiety on one of the provided post-it notes and leave it behind in the box next to the entrance.</li>
        <li>Once you enter the escape room, it will be very dark. Your goal is to find the table in the center of the room and open the box on top of it. Inside the box, you will find a large collection of yellow post-it notes with tips on how to cope with anxiety written on them. At the bottom of the box, you will find a flashlight. Take it.</li>
        <li>Use the flashlight to find the wall of post-it notes inside the escape room. Work together, one member of the team holding the flashlight and the others looking under the yellow post-it notes. All but one yellow post-it note is covering a potential cause for anxiety. Find the post-it that is covering a QR code, scan it, and watch the linked music video.</li>
        <li>Make sure everyone in the group pays attention to the lyrics of the song and the content of the video. This information will come in handy at the final puzzle. For now, though, pay attention to the end of the credits. There will be a phrase that directs you to the next puzzle.</li>
        <li>The phrase at the end of the credits will direct you to look under the table in the center of the room, where you’ll find a black rug. Lift the rug and pull out the portfolio underneath.</li>
        <li>Inside the portfolio, will be sheets containing facts about anxiety. Make sure your team takes only one sheet. Read the text on it carefully to find the clue that will direct you out of the escape room to the final station, the community art project outside.</li>
        <li>Locate the community art project and provided art supplies. Use the art supplies to cover the anxiety fact sheet with artwork and attach it to the wall however you’d like. Make sure every member of your team adds something to the sheet because that’s the goal of this project, artistic collaboration.</li>
