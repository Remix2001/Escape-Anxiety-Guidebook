        <h1>Escape Anxiety Guidebook</h1>
        <p>As your group’s guide, you have the solutions to the escape room. Please DO NOT provide hints until your group has done their best to solve each puzzle. Please return any items to their original location after you’re done using them.</p><br>
        <ol>
        <li>Have each member of the group write their #1 anxiety on a sticky note and place it in the black box next to the entrance. Enter the escape room.</li><br>
        <li>Open the box on the table in the center of the room and retrieve the flashlight.</li><br>
        <li>Use the flashlight to find the wall of sticky notes inside the escape room. Work together to find the sticky note with the “X” written on it and look under it.</li><br>
        <li>Scan the QR code under the note and watch the linked video. Pay attention to both the story and the credits at the end.</li><br>
        <li>Look under the rug beneath the table and read the message.</li><br>
        <li>Leave the escape room and locate the wall of yellow and blue artwork outside. Take only one anxiety fact sheet for your group and collaborate to cover it in art and add it to the community art project.</li><br>
